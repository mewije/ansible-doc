**What is Ansible ?**

Ansible is described as "simple IT automation." It's an agentless tool, meaning you don't have to install anything on the systems you are controlling. With Ansible, you can install software, configure system settings and features, and do all the things system administrators do. You know, the "operations" side of the team.

**What does Ansible do?**
To put it in the simplest terms, Ansible lets you do things remotely that you would otherwise do at the command line. Specifically, it's used to install software and change system settings. It puts a machine into the state in which you want it to remain and keeps it there.

For example, you can install (and maintain) a given version of a library on a select group of servers across your organization. You might want `Python 3.8` on all your Red Hat Enterprise Linux machines running in AWS. Ansible is perfect for that.
